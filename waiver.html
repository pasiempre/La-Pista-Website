            <h2>Waiver of Liability and Release Form</h2>
            
            <p>I, the agreed booking services, in consideration for my voluntary participation in organized soccer, do hereby willfully acknowledge that my booking of services attests to my understanding and agreement that:</p>

            <p><strong>Player Conduct:</strong> My player status will be kept in good standing. I will not compromise myself in such a way as to do harm to Fletcha Soccer Champs Academy, knowing that players may be dismissed from participation, with possible loss of payment or dues, for violent conduct or unsporting behavior on or off the field of play. I agree to pay for any and all damages to any property or indemnities caused by me willfully, negligently, or otherwise.</p>

            <p><strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> Soccer is a physical, contact, sport that involves the risk of injury. I assume all risks and hazards associated with my participation in the sport. I am in proper physical condition to participate in soccer practices and games and have no illness, disease or existing injury or physical defect that would be aggravated by my participation. I will inform my coach if this status changes. I further acknowledge that this risk may involve loss or damage to me or my property, including the risk of death, or other unforeseen consequences, including those which may be due to the unavailability of immediate emergency medical care. I have a current medical consent form in force. I shall wear shinguards, properly-fitted and appropriate shoes, and other protective equipment (e.g., mouth-pieces), as provided by soccer rules, to all events.</p>

            <p><strong>Insurance & Medical:</strong> Fletcha Soccer Champs / Edson M Garcia / LaPista.ATX does not have personal injury insurance that covers my participation. Therefore, I should have a current, active, personal injury insurance policy in force, which covers my participation. Under any condition, I am responsible for any and all medical expenses arising from my participation, in practices, camps, scrimmage or soccer activities. I have the right and responsibility to inspect the equipment and facilities prior to events and, if I believe that anything may be unsafe, I will advise the coach or supervisor of the condition and may refuse to participate. Participation assumes consent.</p>

            <p><strong>Media Release:</strong> I authorize my photograph, picture or likeness, and voice to appear in any documentary, promotion (including advertising), television, video, or radio coverage of the league or tournament, without compensation.</p>

            <p><strong>Form Authorization:</strong> I authorize that an unaltered copy of this form may be generated and given to the officers or directors of other leagues or tournaments in order to allow my participation in their soccer programs, if the form is required and I have requested to participate.</p>

            <p><strong>Release of Liability:</strong> I hereby release, waive liability, discharge, hold harmless, indemnify, and covenant not to sue, Fletcha Soccer Champs / Edson M. Garcia /LaPista.ATX at 4005/4007 Prairie Lane Austin TX 78728 of conduct of, and my participation in, their soccer programs. This includes owners, lessors, and lessees of premises, municipalities, government agencies, successors, heirs, and assigns.</p>

            <p><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> I have completely read this document and fully understand its contents. I acknowledge that I have given up substantial rights by accepting this document and that I do so voluntarily. My signature attests to this on behalf of myself and my executors, personal representatives, administrators, heirs, next-of-kin, successors, and assigns.</p>
